 * the `AST` objects stored in both components (i.e. IDB and CVR).
 *
 * A change in the `AST` schema (e.g. new functionality added) must be
 * accompanied by an increment of the `PROTOCOL_VERSION` and a new major
 * release. The server (`zero-cache`) must be deployed before clients start
 * running the new code.

// History:
// -- Version 5 adds support for `pokeEnd.cookie`. (0.14)
// -- Version 6 makes `pokeStart.cookie` optional. (0.16)
// -- Version 7 introduces the initConnection.clientSchema field. (0.17)
// -- Version 8 drops support for Version 5 (0.18).
// -- Version 11 adds inspect queries. (0.18)
// -- Version 12 adds 'timestamp' and 'date' types to the ClientSchema ValueType. (not shipped, reversed by version 14)
// -- Version 14 removes 'timestamp' and 'date' types from the ClientSchema ValueType. (0.18)
// -- Version 15 adds a `userPushParams` field to `initConnection`
// -- Version 16 adds a new error type (alreadyProcessed) to mutation responses
// -- Version 17 removes `AST` from downstream query puts. It was never used anyway.
